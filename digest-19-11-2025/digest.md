"i am very exhausted by disinformation about the cost of transition healthcare. it costs less than $100 for 1-2 years of hormones, depending on your exact sourcing. presenting HRT as impossibly expensive and inaccessible to people who need HRT but don't know how is equivalent to medical gatekeeping."
